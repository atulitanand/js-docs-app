# js-docs-app

Nice playground to practice tailwind themes and dark mode.

## what did i learned

- react-router-dom
  - docs are good try them
- react, react-dom
  - same'ol stuff
- tailwind css
  - got my hands dirty with tailwind
  - and used `@apply` in style.css to add styling purely in tailwind
  - again docs are nice and they got a playground too, so beautiful

### where to go next

- learn `state management` in react in parallel
- with learning next-app as primary
  - as far as db is concerned react offers great support with `firebase`, so go ahead and do that
